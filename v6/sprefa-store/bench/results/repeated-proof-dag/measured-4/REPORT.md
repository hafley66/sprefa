# Z-set / IVM head-to-head: feasibility lab

Same computation in every engine: reachability from roots {0,1} over a generated
layered graph, then **retract root 0** and recount the survivor set. The PostgreSQL-family
numeric arms compare complete ordered results with an independent BFS oracle
before emitting CSV. Only the root retraction and survivor recount are the
measured operation; setup is reported separately. Requested memory budget:
4096 MB/run. Enforcement and accounting scope are adapter-specific and
recorded below.

Graph back-edge stride: 0 (0 is the layered DAG;
positive values add the existing cyclic workload's child-to-parent edges).
Input-hash gating: 1. When enabled, every numeric
arm must match the shared canonical edge-list SHA-256 in `input-hashes.tsv`.
The tagged store keys are normalized to global node IDs for this comparison.

Ordinary PostgreSQL and PGlite arms execute the recursive query from scratch
after the root deletion. Their timed phase ends after query materialization and
`count(*)`. Ordered full-result transfer, checksum, and exact validation are
recorded in the status receipt and excluded from `setup_ms` and
`retract_ms`. Their rows are full recomputation measurements.

The `differential-dataflow` arm is the native Differential Dataflow 0.25
library over timely 0.31. Its setup and retract phases end after fixed-point
convergence and counting. Complete ordered
initial and survivor sets are checked against an independent BFS outside the
timed phases.

The `swi-incr` arm uses SWI incremental tabling and wall time. Its clock is
reset after initial validation and immediately before root deletion. Both
phases end after table materialization and counting; exact initial-range and
incremental-versus-cold survivor checks run outside the clocks.

The optional `swipl-pure` reference uses CPU time and does not perform an
exact-set oracle check. Keep it outside a wall-time comparison. RSS combines
adapter-specific samples and process peaks, including untimed validation;
the scope receipts describe which processes and limits are included.

Per-cell output and exit codes are retained in `logs/`. Failed processes and
error/timeout/OOM status rows do not contribute numeric measurements. A run
refuses to overwrite existing CSV/status receipts.

When selected, the `sqlite-*` arms call the native store's count, SCC, DRed,
or signed-delta implementation through `perf_report --shared`. The signed-delta-v2
name currently executes full recursive recomputation from zero-indegree rows,
excluding only the current deletion seeds. This one-deletion benchmark passes;
repeated deletion and disconnected zero-weight sequence cases fail. The
`tsv2-runtime` and `sprefa-engine-rs` arms execute compiler-emitted programs
through their actual runtime tick methods. These adapters validate complete
initial and survivor sets outside the clocks, and include counting inside.
The older `tsv2_retract.sh` specialized SQL script is not a generated-runtime
arm and is not selected by `SQLITE_SHOOTOUT`.
