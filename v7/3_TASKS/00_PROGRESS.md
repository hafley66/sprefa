# DL7 minimal kernel progress

Updated: 2026-08-28, Sol contract launch

## Current state

- Plan committed: `52c6d203f`
- Issue DAG committed: `6b82a9d83`
- Active epic: `@dl7-minimal-kernel`
- Spawnable head: `@dl7-kernel-contract`
- Production code added: 0 files
- Tests added: 0
- V6 engine files changed: 0

## Completed

- Read Boop favorites 26 through 37 covering binding, prefix syntax,
  application, interning, compiler phasing, and shared fixpoint semantics.
- Wrote `v7/2_DESIGN/1_MINIMAL_VERTICAL_SLICE.PLAN.md`.
- Capped the first slice at four production modules and one exact test.
- Made `Partial`, `Pick`, and `Exclude` dependent userland proof goals.
- Created the issuectl epic and eleven task cards with model, size, lane,
  collision, and blocker metadata.
- Verified the DL7 scheduling DAG has one head of line.

## Active

- `@dl7-kernel-contract` is `in-progress`.
- Launch Sol from the next local main commit containing this status update.

## Hitches

- Initial `git push` failed because sandbox DNS could not resolve GitHub.
- Escalated push was rejected by the approval reviewer because the remote was
  treated as unverified external egress. Agent worktrees will use explicit
  local base `652f3fde1`; no push workaround will be attempted.
- Repository-wide `issuectl doctor` reports three pre-existing findings outside
  the DL7 epic. No DL7 issue was reported.
